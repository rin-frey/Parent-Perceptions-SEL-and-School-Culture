A hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) study examining how parent perceptions of school culture and school-level climate factors predict children's social-emotional learning (SEL) outcomes in early elementary education. Using nationally representative ECLS-K:2011 data (n=2,452 students), this research reveals that socioeconomic status and school satisfaction are the primary drivers of non-cognitive development, while many assumed school climate factors show limited direct effects.

**Research Questions**

To what extent do parent perceptions about school culture predict children's non-cognitive developmental outcomes?
How are these relationships influenced by school climate factors and inclusive support structures?

**Key Findings**

- School satisfaction significantly predicts SEL outcomes (β = 0.070, p < .001)
- Socioeconomic status emerges as the strongest predictor (β = 0.157, p < .001)
- School-level factors (parent education programs, health services, orientation programs, home language materials) showed no significant effects
- Geographic location (urban/suburban/rural) did not predict SEL outcomes
- ICC of 9.5% justified multilevel modeling approach

**Theoretical Framework**

Grounded in Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, this study examines how parent-school relationships operate within nested environmental contexts to influence child development. The research extends existing literature on parental involvement and academic outcomes to the less-studied domain of social-emotional competencies.
Methods

Analysis: Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) with two-level nested structure
Dataset: Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class 2011 (ECLS-K:2011)
Sample: 2,452 students across multiple schools
Variables:

Level 1 (Child/Parent): Perceptions of teacher contact, school support, information accessibility, satisfaction, parental education, SES
Level 2 (School): Welcoming climate, parent education programs, health/social services, orientation programs, home language materials, urbanicity
